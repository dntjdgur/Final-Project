### This final piece of our project focuses on drawing API query results and exhibiting it via Flasapp. The API will continue to call in the up-to-date information via API.
### The Flaskapp will create a server which will call in Python Predictor Script.
### The Python Predictor Script incorporated the Poisson Model, most optimized fit for sports predictions.

## Poisson's Discrete Probability Distribution
### The Poisson distribution (/ˈpwɑːsɒn/), named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume. - Poisson Distribution from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)
